Regexvalidation-Regexvalidation class is to validate the employee details like mail,id,pn and adress.


Exptest-Exptest class is to demonstrate Java Exception Handling in which we are using a try-catch and finally statement to handle the exception.


Stringthrow-Stringthrow class is to demonstrate the Java Exception Handling in which we are using a Stringthrow concept bu using if-else condition to handle the exception.


Exception1-Exception1 class is to demonstrate the java Exception Handling in which we are using a super statement by using the concept of inheritence and constructor to handle the exception.


NodeRunner-NodeRunner class is to demonstrate the linked list class which add one link to another and display linked list.


map-map class is to demonstrate the java collection in which  we are using hash map concept with for and if condition to handle the java program.
HashMap class implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair, where keys should be unique. If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the corresponding key. It is easy to perform operations using the key index like updation, deletion, etc. HashMap class is found in the java.util package.
Java HashMap is non synchronized.
Java HashMap maintains no order.


Linkedhash-Linked hash is to demonstrate the java collection in which we are using Linkedhash map concept to handle java program.
Linked list implementation of the Map interface, with predictable iteration order. It inherits HashMap class and implements the Map interface.
Java LinkedHashMap is non synchronized.
Java LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order.



Treemap1-Treemap1 class is to demonstrate the java collection in which we are using Treehash map concept to handle java program.
Java TreeMap contains values based on the key. It implements the NavigableMap interface and extends AbstractMap class.
Java TreeMap contains only unique elements.
Java TreeMap maintains ascending order.


EmpD-EmpD class is to demonstrate the java collection in which we are using map concept which explain the map interface  that value can be duplicated and demonstrated it by taking the data of employee id and employee name.


MyThread-MyThread class is to demonstrate the java multithreading using join method to display the working of two threads simultaneously.
